### Bash script to change dates and rename files

```remove_duplicate_files_with_paren1paren.sh```

This is a command-line Bash script to remove all duplicate files that contain: 

```
(1).jpg
```
e.g., 
```
IMG_0375 (1).jpg
``` 

The script takes in 1 command-line parameter, 
```
directory_path
```
which is the location where the duplicate files exist.

**Note**: Script processes only a single directory.
